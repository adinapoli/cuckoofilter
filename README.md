# Cuckoo Filter: Practically Better Than Bloom

This is a (WIP) Haskell implementation of [Cuckoo Filters](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/papers/cuckoo-conext2014.pdf).

## Goals for the project

* Pure Haskell (no C FFI)
* Decent performance
* Low memory footprint

## Status

- [ ] Support insertion
- [ ] Support lookups
- [ ] Support deletion
- [ ] QC & Unit testing
- [ ] Criterion benchmarks

## Disclaimer

I reserve the right of getting bored and do something which actually makes money.
